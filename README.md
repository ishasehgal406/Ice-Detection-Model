# Ice-Detection-Model

This project presents an Ice Detection Model designed to classify the presence or absence of ice on road surfaces, enhancing road safety during adverse weather conditions. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model analyzes a diverse dataset that includes temperature, humidity, and surface texture data.
 
The training process involves exposing the model to various environmental scenarios and optimizing it for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Rigorous testing across different weather conditions validates the model's ability to effectively differentiate between icy and non-icy road surfaces. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.
 
The practical applications of the Ice Detection Model extend to intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles, offering a reliable tool for real-time road condition assessment. This project contributes valuable insights for the integration of similar models into smart infrastructure, ultimately improving road safety during challenging weather conditions. The model presented here serves as a human-centric solution, prioritizing safety for all road users.
